# Snake_Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java language. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing library and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. I created this project to improve my java programming and OOPS concepts. Feel free to clone or fork this repository .
